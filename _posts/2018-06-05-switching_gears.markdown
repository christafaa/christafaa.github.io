For the last three and a half years, I worked at a non-profit arts organization and managed fundraising campaigns. I eventually realized that I don't really like selling things and I miss making things. At the same time, a friend of mine was able to write a Java application that automated a part of my job. Even though I did not write a single line of code, it was still the most engaging project I had worked on all year. I later signed up to codecademy and after a month of learning the basics, I decided to join a coding bootcamp. 

I really enjoyed my time in non-profit arts, I just didn't like the job I was doing. After Flatiron, I intend to return to a non-profit arts organization but in a technical capacity. I think many non-profits aren't able to afford custom software and I'm very interested in trying to solve that problem. I'm really excited that I'm starting this journey with Flatiron.
